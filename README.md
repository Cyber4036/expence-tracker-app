## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to get the Expense Tracker up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
  * **MongoDB**:
      * Locally: [Download & Install MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
      * Cloud (Recommended): Create a free tier cluster on [MongoDB Atlas]

### 1\. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cyber4036/expence-tracker-app.git
cd expence-tracker-app
```

### 2\. Backend Setup (Server)

Navigate into the `server` directory:

```bash
cd server
```

**a. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

**b. Configure Environment Variables:**

Create a file named `.env` in the `server` directory.
Add your MongoDB connection URI to this file:

```dotenv
MONGO_URI="YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING"
```

  * **For MongoDB Atlas:** Go to your Atlas cluster, click "Connect", choose "Connect your application", and copy the connection string. Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your database user credentials. Example: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/expense-tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
  * **For Local MongoDB:** Typically `mongodb://localhost:27017/expense_tracker_db`

**c. Run the Server:**

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5001` (or the port defined by `process.env.PORT`). You should see a message in your console like `âœ… Connected to MongoDB` and `Server is running on http://localhost:5001`.

### 3\. Frontend Setup (Client)

Open a **new terminal/command prompt window** and navigate to the `client` directory:

```bash
cd ../client # If you are still in the server directory
# or if you are in the root directory:
# cd client
```

**a. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

**b. Configure API Base URL:**

Since your frontend will be running locally but connecting to a local backend, you'll use a proxy configuration (Vite handles this well).

  * **For local development, your `client/src/api.js` should point to your local backend.**
    ```javascript
    // client/src/api.js
    // For local development, point to your local backend server
    const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5001/api';
    ```
    *(Note: When you deploy, you'll change this to your deployed backend URL.)*

**c. Run the Frontend:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port). Your browser should automatically open the application.
